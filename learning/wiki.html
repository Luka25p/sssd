        <strong>Lego</strong> (/ˈlɛɡoʊ/ ⓘ LEG-oh, Danish: [ˈle̝ko];[1] <sup> [1]  </sup> stylised as <strong>LEGO</strong>) is a line of plastic construction toys manufactured by the Lego Group, a privately held company based in Billund, Denmark. Lego consists of variously coloured interlocking plastic bricks made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) that accompany an array of gears, figurines called minifigures, and various other parts. Its pieces can be assembled and connected in many ways to construct objects, including vehicles, buildings, and working robots. Assembled Lego models can be taken apart, and their pieces can be reused to create new constructions. <sup> [2][3] </sup>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Lego Group began manufacturing the interlocking toy bricks in 1949. Moulding is done in Denmark, Hungary, Mexico, and China. Brick decorations and packaging are done at plants in the former three countries and in the Czech Republic. Annual production of the bricks averages approximately 36 billion, or about 1140 elements per second. One of Europe's biggest companies, Lego is the largest toy manufacturer in the world by sales.<sup> [4][5] </sup> As of July 2015, 600 billion Lego parts had been produced.<sup> [6] </sup> The line maintains a large fan community based around building competitions and custom creations, and a range of films, games, and eight Legoland amusement parks have been developed under the brand.

        The Lego Group began in the workshop of Ole Kirk Christiansen (1891–1958), a carpenter from Billund, Denmark, who began making wooden toys in 1932.<sup>[7][8]</sup> In 1934, his company came to be called "Lego", derived from the Danish phrase leg godt [lɑjˀ ˈkʌt], <sup>[9][10]</sup> which means "play well".<sup>[11]</sup> In 1947, Lego expanded to begin producing plastic toys.<sup>[12]</sup> In 1949 the business began producing, among other new products, an early version of the now familiar interlocking bricks, calling them "Automatic Binding Bricks". These bricks were based on the Kiddicraft Self-Locking Bricks, invented by Hilary Page in 1939 and patented in the United Kingdom in 1940<sup>[13]</sup> before being displayed at the 1947 Earl's Court Toy Fair.[14] sup Lego had received a sample of the Kiddicraft bricks from the supplier of an injection-molding machine that it purchased.<sup>[15][16][17][18] </sup> The bricks, originally manufactured from cellulose acetate, <sup>[19]</sup> were a development of the traditional stackable wooden blocks of the time.<sup>[12]</sup>

        The Lego Group's motto, "only the best is good enough"[20] (Danish: det bedste er ikke for godt, literally "the best isn't excessively good") was created in 1936.[8] Christiansen created the motto, still used today, to encourage his employees never to skimp on quality, a value he believed in strongly.[8] By 1951, plastic toys accounted for half of the company's output, even though the Danish trade magazine Legetøjs-Tidende ("Toy Times"), visiting the Lego factory in Billund in the early 1950s, wrote that plastic would never be able to replace traditional wooden toys.[21] Although a common sentiment, Lego toys seem to have become a significant exception to the dislike of plastic in children's toys, due in part to the high standards set by Ole Kirk.[22]
